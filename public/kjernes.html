			<li class="description"><p>To extend the mind beyond its comfort zone, and make a conceptual comment via a product that visualises the issue I found interesting about habits. The project sprung from the desire of researching human habits.</p>
			<p>From a collated list of habits taken from my research, I created a fictitious persona called Thomas. For him I made a range of products making him feel safe on the tube.</p>

			<p>“Thomas, the character I created is a slightly eccentric man that was born too early and lived with his mother for a little too long. A home where his mother did not recognise his routines and habits as a suffering, but a factor that made him ‘the most special boy in the world’. She phrased his need for cleanliness and built on them. It went so far that when Thomas grew up he assigned a designer to design him custom made range of products that would prevent him from touching anything outside his house especially public transport. Since that, even though Thomas is still reliant on the public transport for work reasons, he now feels safe on the Underground.”</p></li>
